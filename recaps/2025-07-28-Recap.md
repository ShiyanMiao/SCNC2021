**1. Introduction**

- Genetic variation is essential for the evolution of populations and the breeding of animals and plants.
- Traits controlled by a single gene are called qualitative traits.
- Traits influenced by many genes and affected by environmental factors are called quantitative traits.
- Most economically important traits are quantitative.
- These traits exhibit continuous variation and are described by mean, variance, and other statistical parameters.
- Analysis of such traits requires statistical methods and quantitative genetics theory.

**2. Heritability**

- Heritability is the proportion of the total phenotypic variation that is due to genetic variation.
- Heritability is divided into two types: broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability.
- Broad-sense heritability } $H^2 = \frac{V_G}{V_P}$
- Narrow-sense heritability $h^2 = \frac{V_A}{V_P}$
- $V_G$: total genetic variance; $V_A$: additive genetic variance; $V_P$: phenotypic variance.
- Heritability is population-specific and environment-specific.
- High heritability means selection can be effective.
- Low heritability implies a large environmental effect and selection is less efficient.

**3. Genetic variance**

- The phenotypic variance $V_P$is composed of genetic and environmental components.
- $V_P = V_G + V_E$
- $V_G$can be divided into:
    - $V_A$: additive genetic variance
    - $V_D$ : dominance genetic variance
    - $V_I$: interaction or epistatic variance
- Additive variance  $V_A$ is the most important component for selection.
- Dominance and epistatic variances are more important in crossbreeding and hybrid vigour.

**4. Response to selection**

- The response to selection depends on heritability and selection differential.
- The breeder’s equation: $R = h^2 \times S$
- RR: response to selection;  $h^2$: heritability; $S$: selection differential.
- Selection differential SS: the difference between the mean of selected individuals and the population mean.
- Higher heritability leads to greater response.
- The genetic gain can be increased by:
    - increasing heritability
    - increasing selection intensity
    - reducing generation interval
    - improving accuracy of selection

**5. Genetic correlation**

- Genetic correlation is the correlation between breeding values for two traits.
- Genetic correlation arises due to pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium.
- A positive genetic correlation indicates that selection for one trait will also improve the other.
- A negative correlation means that improvement in one trait may lead to deterioration of the other.
- Knowledge of genetic correlations is important for multi-trait selection.

**6. Genotype × environment interaction**

- G × E interaction occurs when different genotypes perform differently in different environments.
- It can reduce the accuracy of selection and genetic gain.
- It is important to test genotypes in multiple environments.
- Statistical models can partition the variance due to genotype, environment, and their interaction.
- Selection should consider the stability of performance across environments.

**7. Quantitative trait loci (QTL)**

- QTL are genomic regions that control quantitative traits.
- QTL can be identified using molecular markers and statistical methods.
- QTL mapping requires a segregating population, genetic markers, and phenotypic data.
- The basic idea is to test the association between marker genotypes and trait values.
- If the marker is close to a gene affecting the trait, the marker genotype will be associated with the trait value.
- QTL analysis provides information on the number, position, and effect of loci.

**8. Marker-assisted selection (MAS)**

- MAS uses DNA markers linked to QTL to select individuals.
- It allows early and accurate selection, especially for traits with low heritability.
- MAS can be used for:
    - introgression of QTL
    - gene pyramiding
    - background selection
    - reducing phenotyping cost
- MAS is effective when markers are tightly linked to the trait.
- It complements but does not replace conventional breeding.

**9. Genomic selection**

- Genomic selection uses genome-wide markers to predict the genetic value of individuals.
- It includes all marker effects in a prediction model without identifying individual QTL.
- Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) are calculated and used for selection.
- It is especially useful for complex traits and large-scale breeding programs.
- Genomic selection increases selection accuracy and accelerates genetic gain.

**10. Summary**

- Quantitative traits are controlled by many genes and influenced by the environment.
- Heritability is key to determining selection response.
- Genetic variance includes additive, dominance, and epistatic components.
- Selection response depends on heritability and selection differential.
- QTL mapping and MAS help identify and use genetic loci for selection.
- Genomic selection uses genome-wide data for more efficient breeding.
