## The basic concept about inheritance, heritability, genetic map, recombination, and segregation.

**Inheritance**

- Although the document does not define “inheritance” explicitly, the entire framework of QTL mapping is based on the principle that traits are passed from parents to offspring through genes. Quantitative traits are genetically inherited and are controlled by multiple genes, resulting in continuous variation in phenotypes.

**Heritability**

- The document does not give a formal definition of heritability, but it is discussed in the context of marker-assisted selection (MAS). It states that MAS is particularly useful for traits with **low heritability**, meaning traits where **a smaller proportion of phenotypic variation is attributable to genetic rather than environmental factors**.

**Genetic Map**

- A genetic map is defined as a **representation of the relative positions of molecular markers along chromosomes**, constructed based on segregation data and recombination frequencies. It serves as a "roadmap" for locating genes or QTLs controlling traits of interest.

**Recombination**

- Recombination refers to **the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis**. The frequency of recombination between two markers reflects their distance on a chromosome: **closely linked markers recombine less frequently, while markers farther apart recombine more often**. Recombination frequency is therefore used to calculate genetic distances on linkage maps.

**Segregation**

- Segregation is the **genetic separation of alleles in a mapping population**, such as F₂, backcross (BC), or recombinant inbred lines (RI). For QTL mapping to be possible, the markers must segregate, meaning there must be observable variation in the marker genotypes within the population.

## What is QTL？

- QTLs are regions of the genome that contain genes affecting a quantitative trait.
- Most economically important traits in crops are quantitative.
- QTLs typically have small effects and are influenced by environment and epistasis.

## Understand how QTL analysis helps animal or plant breeding.

1. **Identifying genomic regions linked to quantitative traits**
- QTLs are genomic regions associated with traits controlled by multiple genes (e.g., yield, disease resistance, drought tolerance).
- QTL analysis allows breeders to **identify and locate these regions** on chromosomes by linking them to molecular markers.
- This process is often referred to as **QTL mapping**, and it provides breeders with insight into the **genetic architecture** of complex traits.
1. **Linking phenotype with genotype**
- QTL analysis is based on **detecting statistical associations** between molecular markers and measurable traits (phenotypes) in a segregating population.
- By **partitioning the population** based on the presence or absence of marker alleles, breeders can identify whether a marker is **linked to a gene influencing the trait**.
- A significant difference in phenotypic means between marker-genotype groups indicates **marker-trait linkage**, allowing the QTL to be pinpointed.
1. **Improving selection accuracy**
- Traditional selection in breeding is often based on **phenotypic evaluation**, which can be **influenced by environment**, stage of development, or low heritability.
- QTL analysis enhances accuracy by enabling **marker-assisted selection (MAS)**—selection based on DNA markers rather than solely on phenotype.
- This is especially useful for traits:
    - Difficult or expensive to measure
    - Expressed late in development
    - Affected by environmental conditions
    - With low heritability
1. **Accelerating breeding cycles**
- Once QTLs are identified and tightly linked markers are available, breeders can select for these markers **at early growth stages** (e.g., seedlings) without waiting for trait expression.
- This **reduces breeding time**, allowing more generations per unit of time and **faster development of new varieties**.
1. **Gene pyramiding**
- QTL analysis enables the identification of multiple QTLs contributing to a single trait or different traits.
- Markers linked to these QTLs allow breeders to perform **gene pyramiding**, i.e., stacking multiple beneficial alleles into a single line—especially valuable for **disease resistance**.
1. **Marker-assisted backcrossing**
- QTL analysis supports **marker-assisted backcrossing**, in which QTLs from a donor are introgressed into an elite line while maintaining most of the elite genome.
- This is done by using **markers to track both the QTL and background genome**, enabling faster recovery of the recurrent parent.
1. **Reduction in cost and labor**
- In certain cases (e.g., disease resistance), **QTL-linked markers may replace expensive or complex phenotyping assays**, making the breeding process more cost-effective in the long run.
1. **Understanding genetic interactions**
- QTL mapping not only identifies individual loci but also reveals **interactions between QTLs** (epistasis) and **environmental sensitivity** of QTLs.
- This allows for the selection of **stable QTLs across multiple environments**, improving the robustness of breeding outcomes.
1. **Creation of near isogenic lines (NILs) and fine mapping**
- Once QTLs are identified, breeders can develop **NILs** that differ only at the QTL region to validate and fine-map the QTLs.
- This helps in confirming the effect of the QTL and in developing **tightly linked markers** suitable for MAS.
1. **Enabling future genomic approaches**
- QTL analysis lays the foundation for **genomic selection**, where breeding values are predicted based on genome-wide markers, even when individual QTLs are not fully resolved.

## Basic statistical model for QTL analysis

### **What is QTL mapping?**

- QTL mapping links phenotypic data (trait measurements) with genotypic data (molecular markers).
- A segregating population is needed (e.g. F2, backcross, RIL).
- Main steps:
    - Develop mapping population
    - Genotype population with molecular markers
    - Phenotype population for traits of interest
    - Use statistical analysis to detect associations

### **Statistical methods for QTL mapping**

- Single-marker analysis:
    - Tests for association between individual markers and trait
    - Simple but ignores linkage and interactions
- Interval mapping:
    - Uses flanking markers to test for QTLs between markers
    - More accurate than single-marker analysis
- Composite interval mapping:
    - Includes background markers as covariates
    - Reduces noise and increases power
- Multiple interval mapping:
    - Allows detection of multiple QTLs simultaneously
    - Estimates interactions between QTLs

I have another question about this. 

Is storing the SCNC2021 folder in this path meant to make it easier to use git push and git pull? So going forward, should I save each week's R code in the folder shown in the second image for version control?

# 3. Sample size calculation + power analysis calculation for comparing the means of two treatments

By comparing phenotypic values such as yield between two genotypes or treatment conditions.

- Our goal is to perform a hypothesis test:
    - **Null hypothesis H₀: μ₁ = μ₂**
    - **Alternative hypothesis H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂**
- We want to control:
    - Type I error (α, usually 0.05)
    - Type II error (β, so power = 1 − β)

According to classical statistics, for comparing the means of two normally distributed populations, the sample size per group can be calculated by:

$n = \frac{2\sigma^2 \left( z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta} \right)^2}{\delta^2}$

Where:

- $n$: required sample size per group (total sample size is $2n$)
- $\sigma^2$: population variance (assuming equal variance)
- $\delta = |\mu_1 - \mu_2|$: minimum detectable difference in group means
- $z_{1-\alpha/2}$: critical value from standard normal distribution for α
- $z_{1-\beta}$ critical value for desired power (1 − β)

In QTL analysis, such a comparison typically refers to evaluating whether different genotypes have significantly different mean phenotypes, for example,  comparing AA vs aa or AA vs Aa genotypes.

According to Mackay et al. (2009) and related literature:

- The effect size (δ) is defined as the phenotypic mean difference between genotypes.
- The standardised effect size is $\delta / \sigma_w$ , where $\sigma_w$ is the within-group standard deviation.

This means that if the difference between genotypes is small, or there is high variation within groups ( small $\delta/\sigma_w$), then more individuals are needed to detect the difference.

### Power Analysis Illustration (Based on Derivation)

Power is the probability of correctly rejecting H₀ when the alternative hypothesis is true. In the case of comparing two means, if we assume known variance and equal group sizes, the power can be calculated as:

${Power} = \Phi\left( \frac{\delta \sqrt{n/2}}{\sigma} - z_{1 - \alpha/2} \right) + \Phi\left( -\frac{\delta \sqrt{n/2}}{\sigma} - z_{1 - \alpha/2} \right)$

Where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

In molecular breeding, choosing an appropriate sample size ensures sufficient statistical power to detect genetic effects.

As highlighted by Mackay et al.:

- Early QTL mapping studies often used only a few hundred individuals and could only detect **large-effect loci**.
- **With larger sample sizes**, even **small-effect QTLs** can be detected.
- Therefore, sample size calculation is critical for efficient resource allocation and successful QTL mapping projects.

And for SNP association, the file it required to download is so huge like 3-10GB, because my macbook  air just set with 8GB+256GB. I am not quite sure whether to download it or not?

Besides, when I tried to download it. Despite spending long time to run it, it still fail to download the whole file.
