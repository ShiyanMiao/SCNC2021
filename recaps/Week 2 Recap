# QTL analysis

## Principle of QTL analysis

### QTL analysis:

QTL analysis based on the principle of detecting an association between phenotype and genotype of markers.

### Markers:

Markers are used to partition the mapping population into different genotypic groups based on the presence or absence of a particular marker locus and to determine whether significant differences exist between groups with respect to the trait being measured.

Significant difference depends on marker system and type of population.

The closer a marker form a QTL, the lower the chance of recombination occurring between marker and QTL. When a marker is loosely-linked or unlinked to a QTL, there is independent segregation of the marker and QTL.

## Method to detect QTLs

### Single-marker analysis:

Single-marker analysis is the simplest method for detecting QTLs associated with single markers. The statistical methods used for single-marker analysis include t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression.

Linear regression is most commonly used because the coefficient of determination $R^2$ from the marker explains to the marker.

### Simple interval mapping (SIM) methods:

Simple interval mapping method makes use of linkage maps and analyses intervals between adjacent pairs of linked markers along chromosomes simultaneously, instead of analyzing single markers. (statistically more powerful)

### Composite interval mapping (CIM):

Composite interval mapping combines interval mapping with linear regression and includes additional genetic markers in the statistical model in addition to an adjacent pair of linked markers for interval mappping.

SIM and CIM are typically presented using a logarithmic of odds (LOD) score or likelihood ratio statistics (LRS).

LRS=4.6*LOD

LOD and LRS profiles are used to identify the most likely position for a QTL in relation to the linkage map.

Confidence interval for QTLs

1. one-LOD support interval: finding the region on both sides of a QTL peak that corresponds to a decrease of 1 LOD score
2. Bootstrapping: a statistical method for resampling, is another method to determine the confidence interval of QTLs.

### **Consensus and Comparative Mapping**

- Integrating maps constructed from different genotypes into consensus maps facilitates efficient construction of new maps or localized mapping. For example, a consensus map can indicate markers located in a region containing a QTL, helping to identify more tightly linked markers.
- The study of similarities and differences in markers and genes among species, genera, or higher taxonomic levels is called comparative mapping. This involves analyzing the conservation of marker order, known as synteny.
- Comparative mapping aids in constructing new maps, predicting QTL locations, and revealing evolutionary relationships among species.

### **Factors Affecting QTL Detection**

- Key factors include genetic properties of QTLs (such as effect size and linkage distance), environmental effects, population size, and experimental error.
- Only QTLs with sufficiently large phenotypic effects can be detected; those with small effects may fall below the detection threshold.
- Closely linked QTLs (<20 cM apart) may be detected as a single QTL in populations of moderate size.
- Replicated experiments across multiple locations and time points (e.g., seasons and years) help assess environmental influences on traits.

### **Experimental Design Factors**

- The most important design factor is population size. Larger populations enhance statistical power and improve detection of small-effect QTLs.
- Experimental errors mainly stem from genotyping mistakes and phenotypic evaluation errors.
- High-quality QTL maps must be based on reliable phenotypic data; repeated measurements or use of clones (e.g., via cuttings) are recommended to reduce background noise.

### **QTL Map Validation**

- Ideally, QTL maps should be validated by independent studies, also known as replication studies.
- Independent populations derived from the same or closely related parents—or even larger populations—are commonly used for validation.
- Due to limitations in funding, time, and awareness, validation is rare in practice, although some exceptions exist (e.g., soybean bud blight resistance).

### **Use of Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) for QTL Validation**

- NILs are developed through backcrossing to introduce QTL-containing regions into elite cultivar backgrounds, allowing for comparison with controls to confirm QTL effects.
- Empirical studies include traits in crops like tomato, barley, soybean, and rice.

### **Rapid Marker Tagging Methods**

- To save time and cost, two rapid methods are often used:
    - **Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA)**: Constructing two DNA bulks from individuals with extreme phenotypes to identify polymorphic markers linked to the target QTL.
    - **Selective Genotyping**: Only individuals with extreme phenotypes are genotyped to construct linkage maps.
- Note: Selective genotyping may underestimate QTL effects and is unsuitable for single-point analysis—interval mapping methods must be used instead.

### **Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) and High-Resolution Mapping**

- MAS selects traits using markers, but markers from preliminary maps are often unvalidated and not directly applicable.
- Effective MAS requires high-resolution mapping, marker validation, and possibly marker conversion.
- The preliminary aim of QTL mapping is to create a comprehensive framework or skeletal linkage map covering all chromosomes.

### **High-Resolution Mapping and Detection of Tightly Linked QTL Markers**

- Even the nearest flanking markers may undergo recombination with QTLs, reducing their predictive reliability.
- Increasing population size and the number of markers allows identification of more tightly linked markers (high-resolution mapping).
- High-resolution maps help develop reliable MAS markers (<5 cM, ideally <1 cM) and distinguish between closely linked genes.
- Populations with more than 1,000 individuals are typically required to achieve <1 cM resolution.
- High-throughput marker systems (e.g., AFLP) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA) enhance map density.
- Small populations lack sufficient recombination and are not suitable for high-resolution mapping.

### **Using Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) for Targeted Chromosomal Mapping**

Markers polymorphic between NILs and recurrent parents can be used to construct high-resolution maps for specific chromosomal regions, allowing for more precise gene localization.

### **Marker Validation**

- Markers must be validated in independent populations and diverse genetic backgrounds to confirm their predictive utility.
- They should also be tested across multiple cultivars and genotypes.
- Some studies warn that marker-QTL linkages may not remain stable across backgrounds or testing environments.
- Effective MAS markers must display polymorphism across a wide range of breeding materials.

### **Marker Conversion**

- Two scenarios require marker conversion: (1) poor reproducibility (e.g., RAPDs), and (2) complex, costly techniques (e.g., RFLPs, AFLPs).
- RAPD markers can be cloned and sequenced to produce SCAR or STS markers with improved stability and usability.
- SCAR and STS markers are generally more stable, suitable for PCR-based detection, and transferable across related species.

### **Section V: Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS)**

MAS offers significant advantages over traditional phenotypic screening:

- Accelerates breeding cycles and avoids environmental influences.
- Enables selection at the seedling stage.
- Supports gene pyramiding (stacking multiple resistance genes).
- Reduces linkage drag from undesirable genes.
- Facilitates selection for traits with low heritability or difficult phenotyping.
- Figure 15 demonstrates early-generation MAS eliminating undesirable genotypes quickly.

### **Selection of QTLs in MAS**

- In theory, all markers tightly linked to QTLs can be used in MAS.
- In practice, MAS usually targets no more than three QTLs (though cases with up to five exist).
- Even selecting one major QTL can significantly improve breeding efficiency.
- All QTLs selected for MAS should be environmentally stable.

### **Cost-Benefit Analysis of MAS**

- The initial cost of MAS development is high (e.g., up to AUD $100,000 per marker) but can become cost-effective over time.
- MAS is more advantageous when phenotyping is costly, time-consuming, or environmentally sensitive.
- Some studies show that MAS systems for disease resistance are cheaper than conventional screening once developed.

### **Marker-Assisted Backcrossing (MABC)**

- Conventional backcrossing requires 6–8 generations to recover the recurrent parent genome.
- MAS uses tightly linked and evenly spaced markers to accelerate genome recovery.
- Simulation tools like PLABSIM show that MAS outperforms conventional backcrossing (see Figure 16).
- Though initially more expensive, MAS can reduce time to market, leading to economic benefits.

### **Future Trends in MAS and QTL Research**

- Despite current challenges (e.g., insufficient validation, low predictive power), cautious optimism prevails.
- Key drivers for future improvement include:
    - New markers (e.g., SNPs) and high-throughput detection methods;
    - Integration of functional genomics and QTL mapping (e.g., ESTs, microarrays);
    - Multiplex PCR and automation to increase efficiency;
    - High-density maps (SNP + EST + STS) for precise mapping;
    - Comparative mapping to transfer QTL information across species;
    - Map-based cloning to develop perfect or diagnostic markers directly from genes.

# Detailed Derivation: Sample Size Formula for Two-Sample Comparison

We aim to derive the following sample size formula for comparing the means of two normally distributed populations:

\[
n = \frac{2\sigma^2 \left( z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta} \right)^2}{\delta^2}
\]

This formula calculates the required sample size per group to detect a specified difference \( \delta = |\mu_1 - \mu_2| \) between two group means, while controlling both Type I error \( \alpha \) and Type II error \( \beta \) (i.e., achieving power \( 1 - \beta \)).

---

### **1. Problem Setup**

We consider two independent samples from normal distributions with equal known variance:

- \( X_1, X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma^2), \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma^2) \)
- The sample size for each group is \( n \), thus the total sample size is \( 2n \).
- We are testing for a difference in means:
  - Null hypothesis: \( H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \)
  - Alternative hypothesis: \( H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2 \)
- Let \( \delta = |\mu_1 - \mu_2| \) denote the effect size (i.e., the minimum detectable difference between the means).

---

### **2. Test Statistic Construction**

Given equal sample sizes and known variance, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means is:

\[
\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \frac{2\sigma^2}{n})
\]

The corresponding standardized test statistic (z-score) is:

\[
Z = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{2\sigma^2/n}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\]

---

### **3. Rejection Region and Error Probabilities**

For a two-tailed test:

- We reject \( H_0 \) if \( |Z| > z_{1 - \alpha/2} \)
- We want to ensure that, under \( H_1 \), the probability of rejecting \( H_0 \) is at least \( 1 - \beta \) (i.e., the test has sufficient power)

---

### **4. Power Calculation**

Under the alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \), the mean of the test statistic becomes:

\[
\mathbb{E}[Z] = \frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}
\]

Let this be the non-centrality parameter \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}
\]

Then the power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false:

\[
\text{Power} = P(|Z| > z_{1 - \alpha/2} \mid H_1) = P(Z < -z_{1 - \alpha/2} \mid \text{mean} = \lambda) + P(Z > z_{1 - \alpha/2} \mid \text{mean} = \lambda)
\]

Using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) \( \Phi \) of the standard normal distribution:

\[
\text{Power} = \Phi\left( \lambda - z_{1 - \alpha/2} \right) + \Phi\left( -\lambda - z_{1 - \alpha/2} \right)
\]

---

### **5. Solving for Sample Size \( n \)**

To ensure the test achieves the desired power \( 1 - \beta \), we require:

\[
\lambda \ge z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta}
\]

Substitute the expression for \( \lambda \):

\[
\frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{2} \sigma} \ge z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{2} \sigma \):

\[
\delta \sqrt{n} \ge \sqrt{2} \sigma \left( z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta} \right)
\]

Square both sides:

\[
n \ge \frac{2\sigma^2 \left( z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta} \right)^2}{\delta^2}
\]

Thus, the required sample size per group is:

\[
\boxed{n = \frac{2\sigma^2 \left( z_{1 - \alpha/2} + z_{1 - \beta} \right)^2}{\delta^2}}
\]
