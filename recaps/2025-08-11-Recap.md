## Single Marker Models

**Core idea**

- Take each genotyped marker (m₁m₁, m₁m₂, m₂m₂) **individually** and relate it to the trait using a **one-way ANOVA/linear model**:

      $y = \mu + \alpha_M \ (\text{marker additive}) + \delta_M  \ (\text{marker dominance, if included}) + \varepsilon$

- The model assumes there is a real QTL linked to this marker, with **recombination fraction** $r$between them. The **QTL additive effect** is aa and the **dominance effect** is dd.

**Why bias (effect attenuation) occurs**

- The observed “trait means by marker genotype” are in fact **mixtures** of the distributions for the three QTL genotypes, with mixture weights determined by $r$.
    
    For example, for marker homozygote $m_1m_1$, the individuals may carry QTL genotypes  $q_1q_1, q_1q_2, q_2q_2$with probabilities:
    
    $(1-r)^2,\quad 2r(1-r),\quad r^2$
    
    If the trait means for these QTL genotypes are $+a, \ d, \ -a$ respectively, then:
    
    $\mathbb{E}[y \mid m_1m_1] = (1-r)^2a + 2r(1-r)d + r^2(-a) = a(1-2r) + 2dr(1-r)$
    
    Similarly:
    
    $\mathbb{E}[y \mid m_2m_2] = -a(1-2r) + 2dr(1-r), \quad$
    
    $\mathbb{E}[y \mid m_1m_2] = d(1-2r+2r^2)$
    
- **Marker additive effect** is defined as half the difference between the means of the two marker homozygotes:
    
    $\alpha_M = \tfrac12\left(\mathbb{E}[y \mid m_1m_1] - \mathbb{E}[y \mid m_2m_2]\right) = a(1-2r)$
    
    This is the key conclusion: **the marker additive effect equals the QTL additive effect multiplied by the attenuation factor $1-2r$**.
    
    - $r=0$ (marker at QTL): unbiased;
    - $r\to 0.5$(independent): effect completely lost.

**Distribution representation (meaning of the three density equations in the book)**

- Let $f_{q_1q_1}(\cdot), f_{q_1q_2}(\cdot), f_{q_2q_2}(\cdot)$ be the trait distributions for the three QTL genotypes (often assumed normal).
    
    The trait distribution within each marker genotype class is then a **mixture** of these three, with mixture weights determined by $r$:
    
    
    f(y_i) &= (1-r)^2 f_{q_1q_1}(y_i) + 2r(1-r) f_{q_1q_2}(y_i) + r^2 f_{q_2q_2}(y_i),\\
    f(y_j) &= r(1-r) f_{q_1q_1}(y_j) + \left(1-2r(1-r)\right) f_{q_1q_2}(y_j) + r(1-r) f_{q_2q_2}(y_j),\\
    f(y_k) &= r^2 f_{q_1q_1}(y_k) + 2r(1-r) f_{q_1q_2}(y_k) + (1-r)^2 f_{q_2q_2}(y_k)
    
    
    Here $i,k$ are marker homozygotes, $j$ is the marker heterozygote.
    
- Because each group is a mixture, **residual variance increases as $r$ increases**. If dominance is present, variances differ between groups (heteroscedasticity), reducing precision.

**Weller (1986) improvement**

- Model the within-marker genotype distributions explicitly as mixtures, and estimate a,da,d (and possibly variances, $r$, etc.) by maximum likelihood.
    
    This explicitly corrects for bias from recombination and is more robust than a simple single-marker ANOVA.
    

**Table 2.1**

- Left part: recombination probabilities for marker type × QTL genotype.
- Right part: expected value and variance for each marker genotype class

       (variance uses $s=1-3r+4r^2-2r^3$, from second-moment derivations).

- Taking half the difference of the two homozygote expected values yields  $\alpha_M = a(1-2r)$, the direct quantification of distance-based attenuation.

**Pros and cons, and when to use**

- **Pros**: conceptually simple, fast to compute; ideal for initial genome scans / coarse mapping.
- **Cons**:
    - Highly sensitive to distance ($a \to a(1-2r)$);
    - Ignores joint effects and LD with other loci → prone to multiple testing issues / false positives;
    - Dominance and heteroscedasticity reduce precision.

## Multiple Marker Models

**Motivation**

- Fit **multiple markers simultaneously** in one model, to:
    1. Control for confounding from linkage / correlation;
    2. Improve mapping precision (multiple nearby markers jointly point to a QTL);
    3. Address single-marker issues: distance attenuation and uneven marker density.

**Practical challenges**

- **p≫n**: more markers than individuals;
- **Strong collinearity**: markers on the same chromosome are highly correlated (linked), causing OLS to be ill-conditioned, estimates unstable, variances inflated.
- Thus, treating all markers as fixed effects in one model is generally **not feasible**.

**Common strategies**

1. **Stepwise / forward selection**
    - Start from a null model, add markers sequentially by significance or information criterion until no remaining markers are significant.
    - Pros: easy to implement; Cons: unstable, prone to overfitting, ignores model uncertainty and multiple testing.
2. **Ridge regression** (Whittaker et al., 2000; Hoerl & Kennard)
    - Add penalty  $\lambda \sum \beta_j^2$to OLS to **shrink all marker effects jointly**, stabilizing estimation under p≫np\gg n and collinearity.
    - Equivalent to **random effects**: $\beta_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\beta^2)$ (Lindley & Smith, 1972).
    - Intuition: markers near QTL have larger true signals and remain visible after shrinkage; distant markers are shrunk toward zero, serving as **QTL proxies**.
    - **Gianola et al. (2003)** allow marker effects to be **correlated** (e.g., autoregressive or Gaussian kernel), reflecting genome reality.
3. **Xu (2003) Bayesian variable shrinkage**
    - Assume each marker effect is normal but with **its own variance**, proportional to its “importance”:
        
        important markers → larger prior variance → less shrinkage; unimportant markers → smaller prior variance → more shrinkage.
        
    - Estimated via **MCMC**. ter Braak et al. (2005) note possible **improper posteriors** under the original priors and suggest more robust sampling; the “less shrinkage for important, more for unimportant” mechanism is highly practical.
4. **Model averaging / Bayesian inclusion probability**
    - Treat inclusion of each marker as random; in marker-sparse regions, give higher prior inclusion probability (Ball, 2001) to offset disproportionate attenuation from uneven density.

**Key properties and intuition**

- **Distance effect still exists**: whether single- or multi-marker, the farther from QTL, the weaker the observed signal (attenuated ~ $1−2r$).
    
    Multi-marker models can partially recover true signal by including a block of nearby markers, improving localization.
    
- **Bias–variance trade-off**: ridge/Bayesian shrinkage reduces large variance in exchange for controllable bias, improving prediction stability and parameter identifiability.
- **Uneven density**: with uneven marker spacing, single-marker attenuation is disproportionate; multi-marker/model averaging can adjust via structured priors / correlation structures.

**Pros, cons, and practical use**

- **Pros**: joint evaluation, controls linkage & collinearity, improves mapping accuracy, handles p≫n.
- **Cons**: requires tuning/priors, more computation, interpretability reduced (due to shrinkage & correlation).
- **Typical workflow**:
    1. Run **single-marker scan** to find candidate regions (fast, coarse);
    2. Fit **multi-marker model** (ridge/Bayesian/model averaging) in candidate regions or genome-wide for refined estimates and localization;
    3. Monitor rr, marker density, dominance, heteroscedasticity; use cross-validation or posterior diagnostics to check stability.

**Summary:**

- **Single-marker**: fast, intuitive, good for screening; effect attenuated by $1-2r$, prone to multiple testing and heteroscedasticity.
- **Multi-marker**: joint modeling + regularization/Bayesian methods to control linkage & collinearity, boosting localization and prediction stability — the main tool for fine mapping and breeding value prediction.
