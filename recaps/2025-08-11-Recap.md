## Single Marker Models

### Core idea

Take each genotyped marker $(m_1m_1, m_1m_2, m_2m_2)$ individually and relate it to the trait using a one-way ANOVA/linear model:

$$
y = \mu + \alpha_M \ (\text{marker additive}) + \delta_M \ (\text{marker dominance, if included}) + \varepsilon
$$

The model assumes there is a real QTL linked to this marker, with recombination fraction $r$ between them.  
The QTL additive effect is $a$ and the dominance effect is $d$.

---

### Why bias (effect attenuation) occurs

The observed “trait means by marker genotype” are in fact mixtures of the distributions for the three QTL genotypes, with mixture weights determined by $r$.

For example, for marker homozygote $m_1m_1$, the individuals may carry QTL genotypes $q_1q_1$, $q_1q_2$, $q_2q_2$ with probabilities:

$$
(1-r)^2,\quad 2r(1-r),\quad r^2
$$

If the trait means for these QTL genotypes are $+a$, $d$, $-a$ respectively, then:

$$
E[y \mid m_1m_1] = (1-r)^2 a + 2r(1-r) d + r^2 (-a) = a(1-2r) + 2dr(1-r)
$$

Similarly:

$$
E[y \mid m_2m_2] = -a(1-2r) + 2dr(1-r)
$$

$$
E[y \mid m_1m_2] = d(1 - 2r + 2r^2)
$$

---

### Marker additive effect

Defined as half the difference between the means of the two marker homozygotes:

$$
\alpha_M = \frac{1}{2} \left( E[y \mid m_1m_1] - E[y \mid m_2m_2] \right) = a(1-2r)
$$

**Key conclusion:** the marker additive effect equals the QTL additive effect multiplied by the attenuation factor $(1-2r)$.

- $r = 0$ (marker at QTL): unbiased;
- $r \to 0.5$ (independent): effect completely lost.

---

### Distribution representation

Let $f_{q_1q_1}(\cdot)$, $f_{q_1q_2}(\cdot)$, $f_{q_2q_2}(\cdot)$ be the trait distributions for the three QTL genotypes (often assumed normal).

The trait distribution within each marker genotype class is then a mixture of these three, with mixture weights determined by $r$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(y_i) &= (1-r)^2 f_{q_1q_1}(y_i) + 2r(1-r) f_{q_1q_2}(y_i) + r^2 f_{q_2q_2}(y_i), \\
f(y_j) &= r(1-r) f_{q_1q_1}(y_j) + \left(1-2r(1-r)\right) f_{q_1q_2}(y_j) + r(1-r) f_{q_2q_2}(y_j), \\
f(y_k) &= r^2 f_{q_1q_1}(y_k) + 2r(1-r) f_{q_1q_2}(y_k) + (1-r)^2 f_{q_2q_2}(y_k)
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $i, k$ are marker homozygotes, $j$ is the marker heterozygote.

Because each group is a mixture, residual variance increases as $r$ increases.  
If dominance is present, variances differ between groups (**heteroscedasticity**), reducing precision.

---

### Weller (1986) improvement

Model the within-marker genotype distributions explicitly as mixtures, and estimate $a, d$ (and possibly variances, $r$, etc.) by maximum likelihood.

This explicitly corrects for bias from recombination and is more robust than a simple single-marker ANOVA.

---

### Table 2.1

- Left part: recombination probabilities for marker type × QTL genotype.
- Right part: expected value and variance for each marker genotype class  
  (variance uses $s = 1 - 3r + 4r^2 - 2r^3$, from second-moment derivations).

Taking half the difference of the two homozygote expected values yields:

$$
\alpha_M = a(1-2r)
$$

This directly quantifies distance-based attenuation.

## Multiple Marker Models

### Motivation

Fit multiple markers simultaneously in one model to:

- Control for confounding from linkage/correlation;
- Improve mapping precision (multiple nearby markers jointly point to a QTL);
- Address single-marker issues: distance attenuation and uneven marker density.

---

### Practical challenges

- $p \gg n$: more markers than individuals;
- Strong collinearity: markers on the same chromosome are highly correlated (linked), causing OLS to be ill-conditioned, estimates unstable, variances inflated.

Thus, treating all markers as fixed effects in one model is generally not feasible.

---

### Common strategies

#### Stepwise / forward selection

Start from a null model, add markers sequentially by significance or information criterion until no remaining markers are significant.

- Pros: easy to implement;
- Cons: unstable, prone to overfitting, ignores model uncertainty and multiple testing.

#### Ridge regression (Whittaker et al., 2000; Hoerl & Kennard)

Add penalty:

$$
\lambda \sum_j \beta_j^2
$$

to OLS to shrink all marker effects jointly, stabilizing estimation under $p \gg n$ and collinearity.

Equivalent to random effects: $\beta_j \sim N(0, \sigma_\beta^2)$ (Lindley & Smith, 1972).

Intuition: markers near QTL have larger true signals and remain visible after shrinkage; distant markers are shrunk toward zero, serving as QTL proxies.

Gianola et al. (2003) allow marker effects to be correlated (e.g., autoregressive or Gaussian kernel), reflecting genome reality.

#### Xu (2003) Bayesian variable shrinkage

Assume each marker effect is normal but with its own variance, proportional to its “importance”:

- Important markers → larger prior variance → less shrinkage;
- Unimportant markers → smaller prior variance → more shrinkage.

Estimated via MCMC. ter Braak et al. (2005) note possible improper posteriors under the original priors and suggest more robust sampling; the “less shrinkage for important, more for unimportant” mechanism is highly practical.

#### Model averaging / Bayesian inclusion probability

Treat inclusion of each marker as random; in marker-sparse regions, give higher prior inclusion probability (Ball, 2001) to offset disproportionate attenuation from uneven density.

---

### Key properties and intuition

- **Distance effect still exists**: whether single- or multi-marker, the farther from QTL, the weaker the observed signal (attenuated $\sim 1-2r$).
- **Multi-marker models** can partially recover true signal by including a block of nearby markers, improving localization.
- **Bias–variance trade-off**: ridge/Bayesian shrinkage reduces large variance in exchange for controllable bias, improving prediction stability and parameter identifiability.
- **Uneven density**: with uneven marker spacing, single-marker attenuation is disproportionate; multi-marker/model averaging can adjust via structured priors / correlation structures.

---

### Pros, cons, and practical use

**Pros**: joint evaluation, controls linkage & collinearity, improves mapping accuracy, handles $p \gg n$.  
**Cons**: requires tuning/priors, more computation, interpretability reduced (due to shrinkage & correlation).

**Typical workflow**:

1. Run single-marker scan to find candidate regions (fast, coarse);
2. Fit multi-marker model (ridge/Bayesian/model averaging) in candidate regions or genome-wide for refined estimates and localization;
3. Monitor $r$, marker density, dominance, heteroscedasticity; use cross-validation or posterior diagnostics to check stability.

---

### Summary

- **Single-marker**: fast, intuitive, good for screening; effect attenuated by $(1-2r)$, prone to multiple testing and heteroscedasticity.
- **Multi-marker**: joint modeling + regularization/Bayesian methods to control linkage & collinearity, boosting localization and prediction stability — the main tool for fine mapping and breeding value prediction.

# Chapter 1 Overview

## 1. Quantitative Traits and Genetic Background

- **Definition**: Quantitative traits are determined by multiple genes and environmental factors, such as yield, height, and weight.
- **Difference**: Unlike qualitative traits controlled by single genes, quantitative traits have a more complex genetic basis and require statistical methods for analysis.
- **Phenotypic model**:  
  $$P = G + E$$  
  where \(P\) is the phenotypic value, \(G\) is the genotypic value, and \(E\) is the environmental effect.
- **Genotypic decomposition**:  
  $$G = A + D + I$$  
  \(A\): additive effect; \(D\): dominance effect; \(I\): epistatic effect.

---

## 2. Purpose of QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) Analysis

- **Definition**: QTLs are genes or genomic regions that control variation in quantitative traits.
- **Goal**: Identify genetic markers significantly associated with traits for breeding applications (e.g., MAS).
- **Statistical test**:  
  $$H_0: \alpha = 0 \quad \text{vs} \quad H_1: \alpha \neq 0$$  
  where \(\alpha\) is the additive effect of the QTL.

---

## 3. Basic Principles of QTL Mapping

- **Process**: Genotype and phenotype individuals with genetic differences, then use statistical models to analyze associations between marker genotypes and trait values.
- **Linkage effect**: If the recombination rate between the marker and QTL is \(r\), the effect decays as:  
  $$\alpha_M = a(1 - 2r)$$
- **Single-marker linear model**:  
  $$y = \mu + \alpha_M + \delta_M + \varepsilon$$  
  \(\alpha_M\): marker additive effect; \(\delta_M\): dominance effect; \(\varepsilon\): residual.

---

## 4. Main Types of Mapping Populations

- **F₂ population** QTL genotype probabilities:  
  $$P(q_1q_1) = \frac14, \quad P(q_1q_2) = \frac12, \quad P(q_2q_2) = \frac14$$
- **Backcross (BC) population** QTL genotype probabilities:  
  $$P(q_1q_1) = \frac12, \quad P(q_1q_2) = \frac12$$
- **RIL, DH**: high repeatability, suitable for multi-location trials.
- **Natural populations**: used for GWAS, require accounting for population structure.

---

## 5. Overview of Statistical Analysis Methods

- **Single-marker analysis (SMA)**: ANOVA  
  $$F = \frac{\text{MS}_{\text{between}}}{\text{MS}_{\text{within}}}$$
- **Interval mapping (IM)**: maximum likelihood estimation  
  $$\log L = \sum_{i=1}^n \log \left[ \sum_{g} P(g \mid M) \cdot f(y_i \mid g) \right]$$
- **Composite interval mapping (CIM)**: IM with covariates to control background noise.
- **Multiple QTL mapping (MQM)**: estimates positions and effects of multiple QTL simultaneously.

---

## 6. Classification of Gene Effects

- **Expected trait means** for three QTL genotypes:  
  $$E[y \mid q_1q_1] = \mu + a, \quad E[y \mid q_1q_2] = \mu + d, \quad E[y \mid q_2q_2] = \mu - a$$
- **Additive effect (a)**: change in trait value due to allele substitution.
- **Dominance effect (d)**: deviation of heterozygote from the mean of the homozygotes.
- **Epistatic effect**: interaction between loci.

---

## 7. Bias and Power

- **Effect decay formula** (marker-QTL recombination rate \(r\)):  
  $$\text{Observed effect} = a(1 - 2r)$$
- **Approximate power formula (LOD test)**:  
  $$\text{Power} \approx \Phi \left( \frac{\sqrt{n} \cdot a(1 - 2r)}{\sigma} - z_{\alpha} \right)$$
- Small sample size, low marker density, or complex LD structure can reduce power or increase false positives.
